### Colour Scheme

The color scheme will be simple, clean, and focus on a modern interface with a musical touch.

### Imagery

The game's imagery will consist of modern piano graphics and simple notes. The UI will focus on providing a clear, intuitive interface to allow users to focus on replicating tunes.

### Wireframes

The wireframes provide a visual representation of the different pages and features of the app. They serve as a blueprint for the design and layout of each page, helping to visualize the user interface and overall user experience. These wireframes were created using Balsamiq, a tool that enables quick and intuitive sketching of design ideas.
